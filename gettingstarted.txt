Notes on bringing up a brand new PC for Spout development with Go.
==================================================================

- install git from https://gitforwindows.org

- instal Go version 1.13 or later from https://golang.org/dl/

- install visual studio code from https://code.visualstudio.com/download

- install mingw64 using this installer:

    https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win32/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/installer/mingw-w64-install.exe

    *** BE SURE TO USE THESE SETTINGS WHEN INSTALLING mingw64 ***
    Version: 8.1.0
    Architecture: x86_64
    Threads: posix
    Exception: sjlj

- add this directory to your PATH (in System Properties):
    C:\Program Files\mingw-w64\x86_64-8.1.0-posix-sjlj-rt_v6-rev0\mingw64\bin

- in Visual Studio Code, in the "extensions marketplace" section on the left side,
    type in "go" and install the Rich Go language support.
    Also, type in "@builtin git" and make sure the Git SCM Integration is enabled.

- in Visual Studio Code, press shift-control-P to get the command palette,
    then use "Git: Clone" to clone the following repos into a Documents/github/vizicist folder:

        https://github.com/vizicist/gospout.git

    and clone the following repo into Documents/Github/leadedge folder:

        https://github.com/leadedge/Spout2.git

    The directory tree under Documents at that point should look like:

        github/leadedge/Spout2
        github/vizicist/gospout

- in a Git bash shell, run:

    cd $HOME/Documents/Github/vizicist/gospout
    ./makeall.sh

- At that point, it should have compiled these programs:

    cmd/gospout-demoserver/gospout-demoserver.exe
    cmd/gospout-demoserver/gospout-democlient.exe

- From the windows explorer, execute gospout-demoserver.exe, and then gospout-democlient.exe.
    You should see one window with a big spinning cube, and another window with a cube
    whose faces are that spinning cube, received from the first windows via Spout.
